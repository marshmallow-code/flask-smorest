OpenAPI
=======

`flask-rest-api` automatically generates an OpenAPI documentation (formerly
known as Swagger) for the API. It does so by inspecting
the :class:`Schema <marshmallow.Schema>` used to deserialiaze the parameters
and deserialize the responses. A few manual steps are required to complete the
generated documentation.

The documentation can be made accessible as a JSON file, along with a nice web
interface such as ReDoc_ or `Swagger UI`_.

Specify Versions
----------------

The version of the API and the version of the OpenAPI specification can be
specified as Flask application parameters:

.. describe:: API_VERSION

   Version of the API. It is copied verbatim in the documentation. It should be
   a string, even it the version is a number.

   Default: ``'1'``

.. describe:: OPENAPI_VERSION

   Version of the OpenAPI standard used to describe the API. It should be
   provided as a string.

   Default: ``'2.0'``

Documenting Top-level Components
------------------------------------------------------

To add objects within the top-level components object, specify them in the
API_SPEC_OPTIONS Flask application parameter:

.. describe:: API_SPEC_OPTIONS

   A dict to include in the top level components object of the Open API
   definition. It is copied verbatim in the documentation.

Here is an example on how to includes a Security Scheme Object:

.. code-block:: python

    app.config['API_SPEC_OPTIONS'] = {
        'securityDefinitions': {
            'MyToken': {
                'type': 'apiKey',
                'in': 'header',
                'name': 'Authorization'
            }
        }
    }

Adding Documentation Information to the View Functions
------------------------------------------------------

Description attributes for a view function can be passed to the docs with the
:meth:`Blueprint.doc <Blueprint.doc>` method.

.. code-block:: python

    @blp.doc("description": "Return pets based on ID",
             "summary": "Find pets by ID")
    def get(...):
        ...

Register Definitions
--------------------

When a schema is used multiple times throughout the spec, it is better to
add it to the spec's definitions so as to reference it rather than duplicate
its content.

To register a definition from a schema, use the :meth:`Api.definition`
decorator:

.. code-block:: python

    api = Api()

    @api.definition('Pet')
    class Pet(Schema):
        ...

Register Custom Fields
----------------------

Standard marshmallow :class:`Field <marshmallow.fields.Field>` classes are
documented with the correct type and format.

When using custom fields, the type and format must be passed, either explicitly
or by specifying a parent field class, using :meth:`Api.register_field`:

.. code-block:: python

    # Map to ('string', 'UUID')
    api.register_field(UUIDField, 'string', 'UUID')

    # Map to ('string')
    api.register_field(URLField, 'string', None)

    # Map to ('integer, 'int32')
    api.register_field(CustomIntegerField, ma.fields.Integer)

Register Custom Path Parameter Converters
-----------------------------------------

Likewise, standard types used as path parameter converters in the flask routes
are correctly documented, but custom path converters must be registered.

The :meth:`Api.register_converter` allows to register a converter in the ``Api``
object to generate a correct documentation, and optionally to also register it
in the Flask application. (The converter may be already registered in the app,
for instance if it is provided by another Flask extension.)

.. code-block:: python

    # UUIDConverter is already known to the flask app as it is imported
    # from an extension that registers it.
    api.register_converter(UUIDConverter, 'string', 'UUID')

    @blp.route('/pets/{uuid:pet_id}')
        ...

    # CustomConverter is defined in our application and must be registered
    # in the Flask app. A name must be passed.
    api.register_converter(CustomConverter, 'string', 'Custom',
                           name='custom')

    @blp.route('/pets/{custom:pet_id}')
        ...

Serve the OpenAPI Documentation
-------------------------------

Now that that the documentation is generated, it should be made available to
the clients. `flask-rest-api` can define routes to provide both the
documentation as a JSON file and a nice web interface to browse it
interactively. This feature is accessible through Flask app parameters.

.. describe:: OPENAPI_URL_PREFIX

   Defines the base path for both the JSON file and the UI. If ``None``, the
   documentation is not served and the following parameters are ignored.

   Default: ``None``

.. describe:: OPENAPI_JSON_PATH

   Path to the JSON file, relative to the base path.

   Default: ``openapi.json``

Both ReDoc_ and `Swagger UI`_ interfaces are available to present the API.

Their configuration logics are similar. If a path is set, then `flask-rest-api`
creates a route in the application to serve the interface page, using the JS
script from a user defined URL, if any, or from a CDN URL built with the version
number.

.. describe:: OPENAPI_REDOC_PATH

   If not ``None``, path to the ReDoc page, relative to the base path.

   Default: ``None``

.. describe:: OPENAPI_REDOC_URL

   URL to the ReDoc script. If ``None``, a CDN version is used.

   Default: ``None``

.. describe:: OPENAPI_REDOC_VERSION

   ReDoc version as string. Should be an existing version number, ``latest``
   (latest 1.x verison) or ``next`` (latest 2.x version).

   This is used to build the CDN URL if ``OPENAPI_REDOC_URL`` is ``None``.

   On a production instance, it is recommended to specify a fixed version
   number.

   Default: ``'latest'``

.. describe:: OPENAPI_SWAGGER_UI_PATH

   If not ``None``, path to the Swagger UI page, relative to the base path.

   Default: ``None``

.. describe:: OPENAPI_SWAGGER_URL

   URL to the Swagger UI script. If ``None``, a CDN version is used.

   Default: ``None``

.. describe:: OPENAPI_SWAGGER_UI_VERSION

   Swagger UI version as string. Contrary to ReDoc, there is no default value
   pointing to the latest version, so it must be specified.

   This is used to build the CDN URL if ``OPENAPI_SWAGGER_UI_URL`` is ``None``.

   Default: ``None``

.. describe:: OPENAPI_SWAGGER_UI_SUPPORTED_SUBMIT_METHODS

   List of methods for which the '*Try it out!*' feature is enabled. Should be a
   list of lowercase HTTP methods.

   Passing an empty list disables the feature globally.

   Default: ``['get', 'put', 'post', 'delete', 'options', 'head', 'patch', 'trace']``

.. warning:: The version strings are not checked by `flask-rest-api`. They are
   used as is to build the URL pointing to the UI script. Typos won't be caught.
